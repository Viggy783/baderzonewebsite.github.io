<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>Systems Biology of the Cell (580.429 SB3) is a half-semester course required of all BME majors. Progress in biomedicine requires understanding how individual cellular components function together. Cell and tissue engineers can exploit this knowledge for regenerative medicine. Basic researchers need to understand how failures of individual components, for example due to mutation, lead to disease. This course provides the fundamental tools that you will need to develop and apply quantitative models of cellular systems, including protein signal transduction, gene regulation, metabolism, and large-scale network science.</p>

<ol>

Understand concepts of network percolation and giant component and their relevance to disease and information spread. Understand how diffusion creates a distance metric for networks.

</ol>
<h4 id="course-expectations--grading">Course Expectations &amp; Grading</h4>
<p>Each homework and quiz is generally worth 10 points. In-class exams are worth about 40-50 points, and the final exam will be worth about 80-100 points. Course grades will be determined by summing the total points and dividing by the total possible points minus 10. This allows each student to drop one assignment without a grading penalty. This also permits students to miss quizzes for travel to BMES and other conferences, medical school and graduate school interviews, and other events.</p>
<p>Homework assignments are generally due by upload to Blackboard by 11:59 PM on the date due, usually Friday. Late homeworks are not accepted.</p>
<p>Quizzes will be announced at least one main lecture in advance and will be given during the main lecture at the end of the period.</p>
<p>Exam dates are on the syllabus. Usually a single make-up exam date will be scheduled for each exam.</p>
<p>If you must be absent for an academic or professional reason, including BMES or other conferences, medical school or graduate school interviews, or other on-site interviews, please speak to me ahead of time. You must speak to me ahead of time if an absence conflicts with a quiz or exam date.</p>
<p>If you are absent for a non-academic reason, primarily health-related, please have the Dean of Students email me on your behalf.</p>
<h4 id="ethics">Ethics</h4>
<p>The strength of the university depends on academic and personal integrity. In this course, you must be honest and truthful. Ethical violations include cheating on quizzes and exams, plagiarism, reuse of assignments, improper use of the Internet and electronic devices, unauthorized collaboration, alteration of graded assignments, forgery and falsification, lying, facilitating academic dishonesty, and unfair competition.</p>
<p>In addition, the specific ethics guidelines for this course are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Homework: students are permitted to work in groups and to use external resources in preparing homework assignments for this course. Each student must turn in a separate physical or electronic copy of each homework, however, to assist with study and record keeping.</li>
<li>Study materials: all study materials are generally permitted. Advance copies of current-year quiz and exam questions are not permitted, however. Students taking exams at different times, particularly for make-up exams, may not share information.</li>
<li>Quizzes, exams, and the final: only blank paper, pens, and pencils are permitted. Electronic devices, including calculators, phones, and computers, are strictly forbidden. Equation sheets, if necessary, will be provided in the exam itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Report any violations you witness to the instructor.</p>

<p>Students requiring extra time for exams will be permitted to take exams at the SDS Testing Center. Exam times will be selected to overlap with the main lecture if possible, either starting early or finishing late.</p>
<p>A note-taker may be assigned to the course if required.</p>
